The NÖ Finderlein is a companion App for the [Niederösterreich-Card](http://www.niederoesterreich-card.at/) for people who would like to have all important information for the associated destinations at their fingertip.

It additionaly provides an easy way to keep track of the visited locations and can show the destinations sorted by the distance from the current position.

### Development

If you want to help, pull requests are welcome.

This is a [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) Project

A file called "Noefinderlein_Keystore.txt" is needed in the main directory of the Project
It should contain some variables like:
```
noefinderlein_gmapsapikey=INSERT YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY HERE
noefinderlein_apipath=https://noecard.reitschmied.at/api/
noefinderlein_apipath_debug=http://127.0.0.1:58468/api/
```
